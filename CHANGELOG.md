## [Unreleased]

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/LoicGrobol/zeldarose/compare/v0.3.0...HEAD

## Fixed

- Stop saving tokenizers in legacy format *also* when training transformers

## Removed

- The `--overwrite-cache` option, which was a no-op since 0.2.0 has been removed. Resetting the
  cache should be done manually if needed (but usually shouldn't be needed).

## [0.3.0] â€” 2021-04-23

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/LoicGrobol/zeldarose/compare/v0.3.0...v0.2.0

### Changed

- Stop saving tokenizers in legacy format
- Create data dir if they don't exist

## [0.2.0] â€” 2021-04-23

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/LoicGrobol/zeldarose/compare/v0.2.0...v0.1.1

### Added

- `--checkpoint` option to load an existing lightning checkpoint
- DDP sharding is now also possible with `ddp_spawn`

### Changed

- Text datasets are now loaded line-by-line by default and the block mode has been removed.
- We now use [ðŸ¤— datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) as backend, so the datasets are
  implemented as memory-mapped files with dynamic loaders instead of being held in RAM. This
  significantly decrease RAM consumption for a very decent speed cost and allows us to train on much
  larger datasets.
- GPU usage is now logged in `--profile` mode when relevant.
- LR is now logged.

### Removed

- The `--line-by-line` flag has been removed, since this is now the default behaviour.
- The `zeldarose-create-cache` has been removed, since dataset processing now works correctly in
  ddp.
- The `data` module has been completely rewritten and the Dataset classes are no more.
- `mlm.masked_accuracy` since it was not used anywhere.

### Fixed

- Logging has been improved for internal pytorch warnings and pytorch-lightning and ðŸ¤— transformers.

## [0.1.1] â€” 2021-04-06

### Fixed

- Updated some obsolete doc
