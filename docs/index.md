A straightforward trainer for transformer-based models. In others words [a teacher of
muppets](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Zelda_Rose).

> Zelda Rose is a command line interface for pretraining transformer-based models. Its purpose is to
> enable an easy start for users interested in training these ubiquitous models, but unable or
> unwilling to engage with more comprehensive --- but more complex --- frameworks and the complex
> interactions between libraries for managing models, datasets and computations. Training a model
> requires no code on the user's part and produce models directly compatible with the ðŸ¤— ecosystem,
> allowing quick and easy distribution and reuse. A particular care is given to lowering the cost of
> maintainability and future-proofing, by making the code as modular as possible and taking
> advantage of third-party libraries to limit ad-hoc code to the strict minimum. (Grobol, [2023](https://hal.science/hal-04262806))
